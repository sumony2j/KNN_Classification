# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Introduction

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification is a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It belongs to the family of instance-based learning methods, where predictions are made based on the similarity of new data points to the training data. This repository provides an overview of KNN classification along with examples and implementations in Python.


## How KNN Classification Works

KNN classification works by finding the k nearest neighbors of a new data point in the feature space and predicting its class based on the majority class among its neighbors. The choice of distance metric and the number of neighbors (k) are key parameters that influence the performance of the algorithm.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Calculate Distance**:
   - Compute the distance between the new data point and all data points in the training set.
   - Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine similarity.

2. **Find Neighbors**:
   - Select the k nearest neighbors of the new data point based on the calculated distances.
   - The value of k is typically chosen based on cross-validation or domain knowledge.

3. **Majority Vote**:
   - Assign the class label to the new data point based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors.
   - In case of ties, a simple strategy such as choosing the class with the smallest distance average can be used.

## Key Parameters in KNN Classification

- **K**: The number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions. Choosing an appropriate value of k is crucial and can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm.
- **Distance Metric**: The metric used to compute the distance between data points, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity.

## Advantages of KNN Classification

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Non-parametric and does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
- Suitable for both binary and multi-class classification tasks.
- Robust to noisy data and outliers.

## Limitations of KNN Classification

- Computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, as it requires computing distances to all data points.
- Sensitive to the choice of distance metric and the number of neighbors (k).
- Does not learn explicit models and thus cannot provide insights into the underlying data patterns.

## Applications of KNN Classification

- Handwritten digit recognition in image processing.
- Spam detection in email filtering.
- Medical diagnosis and disease prediction.
- Customer segmentation in marketing.
- Predictive maintenance in manufacturing.
